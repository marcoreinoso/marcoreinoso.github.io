  <p>A place I would like to go is a country in Central America called Guatemala. I chose this place because it has always interested me from the stories my father would tell me, since he lived there in his childhood.</p>
  <h2>A person I admire<br>(past or present)</h2>
  <p>A person I admire is Barak Obama, since he still had some left for a second term. Even though a lot of people don't agree with me, he was good for running for eight years.</p>
